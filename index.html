                    Hi, my name is Kyle Brink and i am an aspiring Full Stack Developer. I enjoy complex challenges
                    aswell as helping other peoples dreams and ideas become a reality. I believe that life is all about
                    doing what you love so that it will feel like you never worked a day in your life. This is why i
                    fell inlove with coding because it is my passion to design and build other peoples ideas for them. I
                    enjoy working in a team listening and taking everyones opinion into consideration to come up with
                    the best possible solution.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    In my free time you will find me in the ocean surfing which is my happy place when i am not infront
                    of the computer working on new projects and gathering more information on how to better my coding
                    skills. I also enjoy spending quality time with my family and close friends, going on hikes aswell
                    as watching informative documentaries. My friends call me a workaholic because they will always find
                    me coding but they don't understand that to me its a Life Style not work. This is why i believe
                    everyone should do what they love and as you can tell from what you see. Coding and putting peoples
                    ideas and dreams into reality is what i really enjoy doing.
